# Tunizi Sentiment Analysis Search Engine

# Abstract:
The goal of this project is to design and implement an application that allows to analyze the feelings expressed in the different comments written in Tunisian dialect and to visualize them through an interactive dashboard. We plan to design and compare several deep learning algorithms in order to choose the most performant for the implementation.
The final goal is to achieve real-time analysis of the captured content.



# Introduction: 
Sentiment analysis has been an extremely popular topic in NLP research ever since the emergence of Web 2.0 technologies. Nevertheless, most of the studies presented in sentimental analysis are directed towards the Indo-European language family, with less prominent languages such as Arabic. 
Despite the recent surge in public content in Arabic and more particularly Tunisian content on social networks and the ongoing development of NLP tools, research on the Tunisian dialect still faces challenges, most of which are associated with the dialect itself. 
As a matter of fact, there are three main types of Arabic that constitute the Tunisian dialect. The classical Arabic used in the Quran, modern standard Arabic, which is the formal type of Arabic, and Tunisian dialectal Tunisian, which is a mixture of several different dialects. 
The TUNIZI is a new form of the Tunisian dialect which employs the use of numbers instead of certain letters and requires some certain amount of work and processing in order to be decoded.

# Objective:
The main objective of this work is the creation of a deep language tool enabling the analysis of emotions contained in a textual content written in Tunisian dialect using a Fine-Tuned BERT model and extending also to be applied on custom data, while ensuring a low enough error rate.
